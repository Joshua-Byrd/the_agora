# The Agora

The Agora is a single-page web applicaiton built in Angular 19.2.4 that aggregates news articles obtained from NewsAPI. Users can view the top headlines or news by topic or keyword. Additionally, users can drag story cards to *To Be Read* and *Reading* boards to save them for later. When an article has been read, the card can be dragged to the *Read* board, which will remove it from page.  

## Development server

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
